Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of UConn2402::LFMChirpXCorr.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, UConn2402::LFMChirpXCorr's constructor is in a private implementation class. UConn2402::LFMChirpXCorr::make is the public interface for creating new instances.
